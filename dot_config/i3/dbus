       compton is a compositor based on Dana Jansens' version of xcompmgr (which itself was written
       by Keith Packard). It includes some improvements over the original xcompmgr, like window frame
       opacity and inactive window transparency.

       ----sshhaaddooww--iiggnnoorree--sshhaappeedd
           Do not paint shadows on shaped windows. Note shaped windows here means windows setting its
           shape through X Shape extension. Those using ARGB background is beyond our control.
           Deprecated, use --shadow-exclude 'bounding_shaped' or --shadow-exclude 'bounding_shaped &&
           !rounded_corners' instead.

       ----ddeetteecctt--rroouunnddeedd--ccoorrnneerrss
           Try to detect windows with rounded corners and don’t consider them shaped windows. The
           accuracy is not very high, unfortunately.

       ----ddeetteecctt--cclliieenntt--ooppaacciittyy
           Detect ___N_E_T___W_M___O_P_A_C_I_T_Y on client windows, useful for window managers not passing
           ___N_E_T___W_M___O_P_A_C_I_T_Y of client windows to frame windows.

           Specify refresh rate of the screen. If not specified or 0, compton will try detecting this
           with X RandR extension.

       ----vvssyynncc _V_S_Y_N_C___M_E_T_H_O_D
           Set VSync method. VSync methods currently available:

           •   _n_o_n_e: No VSync

           •   _d_r_m: VSync with _D_R_M___I_O_C_T_L___W_A_I_T___V_B_L_A_N_K. May only work on some (DRI-based) drivers.

           •   _o_p_e_n_g_l: Try to VSync with _S_G_I___v_i_d_e_o___s_y_n_c OpenGL extension. Only work on some drivers.

           •   _o_p_e_n_g_l_-_o_m_l: Try to VSync with _O_M_L___s_y_n_c___c_o_n_t_r_o_l OpenGL extension. Only work on some
               drivers.

           •   _o_p_e_n_g_l_-_s_w_c: Try to VSync with _S_G_I___s_w_a_p___c_o_n_t_r_o_l OpenGL extension. Only work on some
               drivers. Works only with GLX backend. Known to be most effective on many drivers. Does
               not guarantee to control paint timing.

           •   _o_p_e_n_g_l_-_m_s_w_c: Try to VSync with _M_E_S_A___s_w_a_p___c_o_n_t_r_o_l OpenGL extension. Basically the same
               as _o_p_e_n_g_l_-_s_w_c above, except the extension we use.

           (Note some VSync methods may not be enabled at compile time.)

       ----vvssyynncc--aaggggrreessssiivvee
           Attempt to send painting request before VBlank and do XFlush() during VBlank. Reported to
           work pretty terribly. This switch may be lifted out at any moment.

       ----aallpphhaa--sstteepp _V_A_L_U_E
           X Render backend: Step for pregenerating alpha pictures. (0.01 - 1.0, defaults to 0.03)

       ----ddbbee
           Enable DBE painting mode, intended to use with VSync to (hopefully) eliminate tearing.
           Reported to have no effect, though.

       ----ppaaiinntt--oonn--oovveerrllaayy
           Painting on X Composite overlay window instead of on root window.

       ----ssww--ooppttii
           Limit compton to repaint at most once every 1 / _r_e_f_r_e_s_h___r_a_t_e second to boost performance.
           This should not be used with ----vvssyynncc drm/opengl/opengl-oml as they essentially does
           ----ssww--ooppttii's job already, unless you wish to specify a lower refresh rate than the actual
           value.

       ----uussee--eewwmmhh--aaccttiivvee--wwiinn
           Use EWMH ___N_E_T___A_C_T_I_V_E___W_I_N_D_O_W to determine currently focused window, rather than listening
           to _F_o_c_u_s_I_n/_F_o_c_u_s_O_u_t event. Might have more accuracy, provided that the WM supports it.

       ----rreessppeecctt--pprroopp--sshhaaddooww
           Respect ___C_O_M_P_T_O_N___S_H_A_D_O_W. This a prototype-level feature, which you must not rely on.

       ----uunnrreeddiirr--iiff--ppoossssiibbllee
           Unredirect all windows if a full-screen opaque window is detected, to maximize performance
           for full-screen windows. Known to cause flickering when redirecting/unredirecting windows.
           ----ppaaiinntt--oonn--oovveerrllaayy may make the flickering less obvious.

           Specify a list of conditions of windows that should always be considered focused.

       ----iinnaaccttiivvee--ddiimm--ffiixxeedd
           Use fixed inactive dim value, instead of adjusting according to window opacity.

       ----ddeetteecctt--ttrraannssiieenntt
           Use _W_M___T_R_A_N_S_I_E_N_T___F_O_R to group windows, and consider windows in the same group focused at
           the same time.

       ----ddeetteecctt--cclliieenntt--lleeaaddeerr
           Use _W_M___C_L_I_E_N_T___L_E_A_D_E_R to group windows, and consider windows in the same group focused at
           the same time.  _W_M___T_R_A_N_S_I_E_N_T___F_O_R has higher priority if ----ddeetteecctt--ttrraannssiieenntt is enabled,
           too.

       ----bblluurr--bbaacckkggrroouunndd
           Blur background of semi-transparent / ARGB windows. Bad in performance, with
           driver-dependent behavior. The name of the switch may change without prior notifications.

       ----bblluurr--bbaacckkggrroouunndd--ffrraammee
           Blur background of windows when the window frame is not opaque. Implies ----bblluurr--bbaacckkggrroouunndd.
           Bad in performance, with driver-dependent behavior. The name may change.

       ----bblluurr--bbaacckkggrroouunndd--ffiixxeedd
           Use fixed blur strength rather than adjusting according to window opacity.

       ----bblluurr--mmeetthhoodd _A_L_G_O_R_I_T_H_M
           Specify the algorithm for background blur. It is either one of: convolution (default),
           kawase.

           Note: kawase only works with the glx backend.

       ----bblluurr--ssttrreennggtthh _L_E_V_E_L
           Only valid for ----bblluurr--mmeetthhoodd kkaawwaassee! The strength of the kawase blur as an integer between
           1 and 20. Defaults to 5.

       ----bblluurr--kkeerrnn _M_A_T_R_I_X

           following format:

               WIDTH,HEIGHT,ELE1,ELE2,ELE3,ELE4,ELE5...

           The element in the center must not be included, it will be forever 1.0 or changing based
           on opacity, depending on whether you have --blur-background-fixed. Yet the automatic
           adjustment of blur factor may not work well with a custom blur kernel.

           A 7x7 Gaussian blur kernel (sigma = 0.84089642) looks like:

               --blur-kern '7,7,0.000003,0.000102,0.000849,0.001723,0.000849,0.000102,0.000003,0.000102,0.003494,0.029143,0.059106,0.029143,0.003494,0.000102,0.000849,0.029143,0.243117,0.493069,0.243117,0.029143,0.000849,0.001723,0.059106,0.493069,0.493069,0.059106,0.001723,0.000849,0.029143,0.243117,0.493069,0.243117,0.029143,0.000849,0.000102,0.003494,0.029143,0.059106,0.029143,0.003494,0.000102,0.000003,0.000102,0.000849,0.001723,0.000849,0.000102,0.000003'

           May also be one of the predefined kernels: 3x3box (default), 5x5box, 7x7box, 3x3gaussian,
           5x5gaussian, 7x7gaussian, 9x9gaussian, 11x11gaussian. All Gaussian kernels are generated
           with sigma = 0.84089642 . You may use the accompanied compton-convgen.py to generate blur
           kernels.

           Resize damaged region by a specific number of pixels. A positive value enlarges it while a
           negative one shrinks it. If the value is positive, those additional pixels will not be
           actually painted to screen, only used in blur calculation, and such. (Due to technical
           limitations, with ----ddbbee or ----ggllxx--sswwaapp--mmeetthhoodd, those pixels will still be incorrectly
           painted to screen.) Primarily used to fix the line corruption issues of blur, in which
           case you should use the blur radius value here (e.g. with a 3x3 kernel, you should use
           ----rreessiizzee--ddaammaaggee 1, with a 5x5 one you use ----rreessiizzee--ddaammaaggee 2, and so on). May or may not
           work with --glx-no-stencil. Shrinking doesn’t function correctly.

           Specify a X geometry that describes the region in which shadow should not be painted in,
           such as a dock window region. Use --shadow-exclude-reg x10+0-0, for example, if the 10

           Specify the backend to use: xrender, glx, or xr_glx_hybrid.  xrender is the default one.

           •   xrender backend performs all rendering operations with X Render extension. It is what
               xcompmgr uses, and is generally a safe fallback when you encounter rendering artifacts
               or instability.

           •   glx (OpenGL) backend performs all rendering operations with OpenGL. It is more
               friendly to some VSync methods, and has significantly superior performance on color
               inversion (--invert-color-include) or blur (--blur-background). It requires proper
               OpenGL 2.0 support from your driver and hardware. You may wish to look at the GLX
               performance optimization options below.  --xrender-sync and --xrender-sync-fence might
               be needed on some systems to avoid delay in changes of screen contents.

           •   xr_glx_hybrid backend renders the updated screen contents with X Render and presents
               it on the screen with GLX. It attempts to address the rendering issues some users
               encountered with GLX backend and enables the better VSync of GLX backends.
               --vsync-use-glfinish might fix some rendering issues with this backend.

           GLX backend: Avoid using stencil buffer, useful if you don’t have a stencil buffer. Might

           on rapid window content changes, but is known to break things on some drivers (LLVMpipe,

       ----ggllxx--sswwaapp--mmeetthhoodd undefined/exchange/copy/3/4/5/6/buffer-age
           GLX backend: GLX buffer swap method we assume. Could be undefined (0), copy (1), exchange
           (2), 3-6, or buffer-age (-1).  undefined is the slowest and the safest, and the default
           value.  copy is fastest, but may fail on some drivers, 2-6 are gradually slower but safer
           (6 is still faster than 0). Usually, double buffer means 2, triple buffer means 3.
           buffer-age means auto-detect using _G_L_X___E_X_T___b_u_f_f_e_r___a_g_e, supported by some drivers. Useless

       Some options accept a condition string to match certain windows. A condition string is formed
       by one or more conditions, joined by logical operators.

       A condition with "exists" operator looks like this:

           <NEGATION> <TARGET> <CLIENT/FRAME> [<INDEX>] : <FORMAT> <TYPE>

       With equals operator it looks like:

           <NEGATION> <TARGET> <CLIENT/FRAME> [<INDEX>] : <FORMAT> <TYPE> <NEGATION> <OP QUALIFIER> <MATCH TYPE> = <PATTERN>

       With greater-than/less-than operators it looks like:

           <NEGATION> <TARGET> <CLIENT/FRAME> [<INDEX>] : <FORMAT> <TYPE> <NEGATION> <OPERATOR> <PATTERN>

       _N_E_G_A_T_I_O_N (optional) is one or more exclamation marks;

       _T_A_R_G_E_T is either a predefined target name, or the name of a window property to match.
       Supported predefined targets are id, x, y, x2 (x + widthb), y2, width, height, widthb (width +
       2 * border_width), heightb, override_redirect, argb (whether the window has an ARGB visual),
       focused, wmwin (whether the window looks like a WM window, i.e. has no child window with
       WM_STATE and is not override-redirected), bounding_shaped, rounded_corners (requires
       ----ddeetteecctt--rroouunnddeedd--ccoorrnneerrss), client (ID of client window), window_type (window type in string),
       leader (ID of window leader), name, class_g (= WM_CLASS[1]), class_i (= WM_CLASS[0]), and
       role.

       _C_L_I_E_N_T_/_F_R_A_M_E is a single @ if the window attribute should be be looked up on client window,
       nothing if on frame window;

       _I_N_D_E_X (optional) is the index number of the property to look up. For example, [2] means look
       at the third value in the property. Do not specify it for predefined targets.

       _F_O_R_M_A_T (optional) specifies the format of the property, 8, 16, or 32. On absence we use format
       X reports. Do not specify it for predefined or string targets.

       _T_Y_P_E is a single character representing the type of the property to match for: c for _C_A_R_D_I_N_A_L,
       a for _A_T_O_M, w for _W_I_N_D_O_W, d for _D_R_A_W_A_B_L_E, s for _S_T_R_I_N_G (and any other string types, such as
       _U_T_F_8___S_T_R_I_N_G). Do not specify it for predefined targets.

       _O_P _Q_U_A_L_I_F_I_E_R (optional), applicable only for equals operator, could be ? (ignore-case).

       _M_A_T_C_H _T_Y_P_E (optional), applicable only for equals operator, could be nothing (exact match), *
       (match anywhere), ^ (match from start), % (wildcard), or ~ (PCRE regular expression).

       _O_P_E_R_A_T_O_R is one of = (equals), <, >, <=, =>, or nothing (exists). Exists operator checks
       whether a property exists on a window (but for predefined targets, exists means != 0 then).

       _P_A_T_T_E_R_N is either an integer or a string enclosed by single or double quotes. Python-3-style
       escape sequences and raw string are supported in the string format.

       Supported logical operators are && (and) and || (or). && has higher precedence than ||,
       left-to-right associativity. Use parentheses to change precedence.

       Examples:

           # If the window is focused
           focused
           focused = 1
           # If the window is not override-redirected
           !override_redirect
           override_redirect = false
           override_redirect != true
           override_redirect != 1
           # If the window is a menu
           window_type *= "menu"
           _NET_WM_WINDOW_TYPE@:a *= "MENU"
           # If the window name contains "Firefox", ignore case
           name *?= "Firefox"
           _NET_WM_NAME@:s *?= "Firefox"
           # If the window name ends with "Firefox"
           name %= "*Firefox"
           name ~= "Firefox$"
           # If the window has a property _COMPTON_SHADOW with value 0, type CARDINAL,
           # format 32, value 0, on its frame window
           _COMPTON_SHADOW:32c = 0
           # If the third value of _NET_FRAME_EXTENTS is less than 20, or there's no
           # _NET_FRAME_EXTENTS property on client window
           _NET_FRAME_EXTENTS@[2]:32c < 20 || !_NET_FRAME_EXTENTS@:32c
           # The pattern here will be parsed as "dd4"
           name = "\x64\x64\o64"

       This is the old condition format we once used. Support of this format might be removed in the
       future.

           condition = TARGET:TYPE[FLAGS]:PATTERN

       _T_A_R_G_E_T is one of "n" (window name), "i" (window class instance), "g" (window general class),
       and "r" (window role).

       _T_Y_P_E is one of "e" (exact match), "a" (match anywhere), "s" (match from start), "w"
       (wildcard), and "p" (PCRE regular expressions, if compiled with the support).

       _F_L_A_G_S could be a series of flags. Currently the only defined flag is "i" (ignore case).

       _P_A_T_T_E_R_N is the actual pattern string.

       compton could read from a configuration file if libconfig support is compiled in. If ----ccoonnffiigg
       is not used, compton will seek for a configuration file in $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/compton.conf
       (~/.config/compton.conf, usually), then ~/.compton.conf, then compton.conf under
       $XDG_CONFIG_DIRS (often /etc/xdg/compton.conf).

       compton uses general libconfig configuration file format. A sample configuration file is
       available as compton.sample.conf in the source tree. Most commandline switches each could be
       replaced with an option in configuration file, thus documented above. Window-type-specific
       settings are exposed only in configuration file and has the following format:

           wintypes:
           {
             WINDOW_TYPE = { fade = BOOL; shadow = BOOL; opacity = FLOAT; focus = BOOL; };
           };

       _W_I_N_D_O_W___T_Y_P_E is one of the 15 window types defined in EWMH standard: "unknown", "desktop",
       "dock", "toolbar", "menu", "utility", "splash", "dialog", "normal", "dropdown_menu",
       "popup_menu", "tooltip", "notify", "combo", and "dnd". "fade" and "shadow" controls
       window-type-specific shadow and fade settings. "opacity" controls default opacity of the
       window type. "focus" controls whether the window of this type is to be always considered
       focused. (By default, all window types except "normal" and "dialog" has this on.)

       It’s possible to control compton via D-Bus messages, by running compton with ----ddbbuuss and send
       messages to com.github.chjj.compton.<DISPLAY>. <DISPLAY> is the display used by compton, with
       all non-alphanumeric characters transformed to underscores. For DISPLAY=:0.0 you should use
       com.github.chjj.compton._0_0, for example.

       The D-Bus methods and signals are not yet stable, thus undocumented right now.

       •   Disable configuration file parsing:

               $ compton --config /dev/null

       •   Run compton with client-side shadow and fading, disable shadow on dock windows and
           drag-and-drop windows:

               $ compton -cCGf

       •   Same thing as above, plus making inactive windows 80% transparent, making frame 80%
           transparent, don’t fade on window open/close, enable software optimization, and fork to
           background:

               $ compton -bcCGf -i 0.8 -e 0.8 --no-fading-openclose --sw-opti

       •   Avoid drawing shadows on wbar window:

               $ compton -c --shadow-exclude 'class_g = "wbar"'
